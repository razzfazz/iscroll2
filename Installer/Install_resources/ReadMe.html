<h2>Two-Finger-Scrolling with pre-2005 PowerBooks and iBooks</h2>

<h3>What's this all about?</h3>

<p>This is a hack to activate two-finger scrolling on supported pre-2005 
PowerBooks and iBooks (i.e. those with a "W-Enhanced" trackpad, including most AlBooks and recent iBooks) on OS X 10.3.</p>

<p>It is based on Apple's AppleADBMouse-209.0.10 driver that 
is available as part of the publicly released Darwin source code. As such, the driver is covered by the <a href='http://www.opensource.apple.com/apsl/'>APSL</a>.</p>

<h3>How do I scroll, then?</h3>

<p>To enable scrolling mode, just place two fingers on your trackpad instead of one. Both fingers need to be placed next to each other horizontally (<i>not</i> vertically). Some people get better results with their finger spaced a little bit apart, while others prefer having the fingers right next to each other.</p>

<p>The hack enables three <strong>scrolling modes</strong>: Vertical, horizontal and circular.</p>

<p>For <strong>vertical</strong> and <strong>horizontal</strong> scrolling, move the two fingers up/down or left/right in a straight line, respectively, to scroll in that direction.</p>

<p><strong>Circular</strong> scrolling works similar to the iPod's scroll wheel: Move the two fingers in a circle to scroll up or down, depending on whether you move in a clockwise or 
counterclockwise direction.</p>

<h3>Scrolling seems to be a little jumpy sometimes, what's up with that?</h3>
<p>This usually happens when the driver mixes up X/Y and rotational scrolling. Enabling just one of the two at a time should help.</p>

<p>Also, several people suggested they get better results if they disable "Use smooth scrolling" under "Appearance" in System Preferences.</p>

<p>In addition to scrolling, the driver also turns left clicks into right clicks whenever two fingers are on the trackpad. This works with the trackpad button as well as with click-and-drag movement.</p>
