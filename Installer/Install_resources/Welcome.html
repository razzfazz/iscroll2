<p>This is a hack to activate two-finger scrolling on supported pre-2005 
PowerBooks and iBooks (i.e. those with a "W-Enhanced" trackpad, including most AlBooks and recent iBooks) on OS X 10.3.</p>

<p>It is based on Apple's AppleADBMouse-209.0.10 driver that 
is available as part of the publicly released Darwin source code. As such, the driver is covered by the <a href='http://www.opensource.apple.com/apsl/'>APSL</a>.</p>
